# 3D Visualization and Pricing Update Instructions

## Real-Time 3D Visualization Requirements

When implementing the Arena customization platform, the following requirements must be incorporated for the 3D visualization and pricing update functionality:

1. **Instant Component Visualization**
   - When a user selects any customization option, the 3D model must update immediately (within 0.5 seconds)
   - The selected component should briefly highlight with a subtle glow effect to draw attention to the changed area
   - Camera should automatically pivot to focus on the newly added/changed component for 2 seconds before returning to the previous view angle

2. **Component Addition Animation**
   - Each time a new component is selected, implement a smooth installation animation
   - For example: wheels should appear to be mounted, exhaust systems should slide into place, body kits should fade in
   - Animation duration should be brief (1-1.5 seconds) to maintain user engagement without causing frustration

3. **Interactive 3D Controls**
   - Users must be able to rotate the vehicle 360° horizontally using drag gestures
   - Vertical rotation should be limited to 60° above and below the horizon line
   - Pinch-to-zoom functionality with minimum/maximum zoom limits appropriate to the vehicle size
   - Double-tap on a specific area should zoom in on that component for detailed viewing

4. **Lighting and Environment**
   - Dynamic lighting system that shows realistic reflections on painted surfaces, chrome, and glass
   - Environment rotation option to view the vehicle under different lighting conditions (showroom, daylight, evening, etc.)
   - Optional toggle for studio lighting vs. real-world environment backdrop

5. **Cross-Section Views**
   - For certain components (engine modifications, interior upgrades), provide option for cross-section or transparent views
   - "X-ray mode" toggle to see how internal components fit together
   - "Exploded view" option for certain customization categories to show component placement

## Real-Time Pricing Update Requirements

1. **Dynamic Price Display**
   - Pricing information must update instantly when a component is added, removed or changed
   - Price changes should be highlighted with a brief animation (fade, pulse, or highlight effect)
   - Display both individual component price and updated total price

2. **Cost Breakdown Panel**
   - Maintain an always-visible or easily accessible breakdown of all selected modifications
   - Organize costs by customization categories (exterior, interior, performance, etc.)
   - Show base vehicle price separate from customization costs
   - Include any applicable taxes, installation charges, and potential discounts

3. **Budget Management Features**
   - Optional budget setter that warns users when they approach their specified limit
   - Visual indicator (like a progress bar) showing proportion of budget used
   - Suggestions for alternative lower-cost options when budget is exceeded

4. **Bundle Pricing**
   - Automatically detect when selected components qualify for bundle discounts
   - Show original price with strikethrough and new bundle price with highlight
   - Suggest complementary items that would create a bundle discount

5. **Installation Cost Integration**
   - For each component, show separate line items for part cost and installation cost
   - Option to toggle between "self-installation" and "professional installation" with appropriate price adjustment
   - Combined installation discount when multiple components in the same category are selected

## User Feedback System

1. **Visual Confirmation**
   - Each successful component addition should trigger a small confirmation animation and sound effect
   - Incompatible selections should trigger a warning animation and explanation tooltip
   - "Before and after" toggle to quickly compare modified view with stock vehicle

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Visual indicator showing customization progress by category
   - Suggestions for popular or recommended next components based on current selections
   - Save point creation at important milestones with thumbnail preview of vehicle state

3. **Performance Impact Meters**
   - For performance modifications, show real-time impact on vehicle specifications
   - Visual gauges for power, torque, fuel efficiency, etc. that update with each relevant modification
   - Compatibility warnings when certain modifications might negatively interact

## Mobile-Specific Requirements

1. **Optimized Control Scheme**
   - Simplified touch controls for rotation and zoom on smaller screens
   - Component selection through tap-targeted hotspots on the vehicle
   - Swipe navigation between customization categories

2. **Reduced Rendering Quality Options**
   - Automatic quality adjustment based on device capability
   - Manual quality controls to prioritize performance on older devices
   - Option to temporarily hide other components while focusing on current selection area

3. **View Presets**
   - Pre-configured camera angles for quick viewing of key areas (front, side, rear, interior)
   - Option to save custom view angles for future reference
   - Quick-toggle between exterior and interior views

## Implementation Notes

1. **WebGL Optimization**
   - Implement level-of-detail (LOD) rendering to maintain performance
   - Use texture compression appropriate for target devices
   - Implement progressive loading of high-resolution textures

2. **User Experience Consistency**
   - Ensure that price updates and visual updates are always synchronized
   - Maintain consistent animation timing across different device capabilities
   - Implement a "lite mode" for users with lower-end devices or slow connections

3. **Fallback Options**
   - For devices that cannot handle real-time 3D rendering, provide high-quality 2D image alternatives
   - Pre-rendered views from multiple angles for each customization option
   - Clear notification to user when falling back to simplified visualization mode

These instructions ensure that as users interact with the Arena customization platform, they will experience seamless visual feedback through the 3D vehicle model while receiving transparent, real-time pricing updates for every component added, creating an engaging and informative customization experience.
