Vehicle Customization Platform - Developer Brief
Project Overview
Create a high-end, gamified vehicle customization platform where users can customize various types of vehicles (two-wheeler, three-wheeler, four-wheeler, and heavy vehicles) with real-time 3D rendering and interactive elements. The platform should offer a premium user experience similar to AAA video game quality while maintaining practical real-world applications.
