# Emergency Services Website Development Prompt

## Core Functionality Requirements

Create an emergency services interface with the following specifications:

1. **Default Landing Configuration**:
   - The emergency page should automatically load the "Domestic (India)" view as the default tab when opened
   - All 9 domestic emergency service cards should be fully functional and pre-loaded
   - Cards should be arranged in a 3Ã—3 grid with proper spacing and visual hierarchy

2. **Tab Navigation System**:
   - Design a prominent tab navigation bar at the top of the page
   - "Domestic" tab should be pre-selected with clear visual indication (highlighted, underlined, etc.)
   - "International" tab should be clearly visible as an alternative option
   - Tab switching should be instantaneous with no page reload

3. **Visual Design Elements**:
   - Use a high-contrast color scheme optimized for emergency situations
   - Implement consistent visual language across both domestic and international views
   - Ensure all interactive elements have proper hover/active states
   - Optimize typography for maximum readability under stress

4. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Ensure all card touch targets are appropriately sized for emergency use
   - Pre-load international card data to minimize switching delay
   - Implement proper state management to preserve user navigation path
   - Optimize for both desktop and mobile emergency scenarios

5. **Accessibility Considerations**:
   - Ensure tab navigation works with keyboard controls
   - Implement proper ARIA roles for screen reader compatibility
   - Maintain adequate color contrast for all emergency scenarios
   - Include voice command capability for hands-free operation

Deliver a responsive, intuitive emergency interface that prioritizes immediate access to domestic services while maintaining easy switching to international support when needed.
